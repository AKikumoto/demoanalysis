# Clustering electrodes by temporal profiles in electrocorticography

This repository contains notebooks with example pipelines for
unsupervised ECoG analysis.

1. `demo_analysis.ipynb` is the primary notebook and has a pipeline showing how to combine PCA plus heirarchical clustering analysis (includes plots)
2. `PCA_withEFA_R.ipynb` runs PCA with rotation using EFA to determine
   the number of components to keep. Note this notebook requires an R
   kernel.
